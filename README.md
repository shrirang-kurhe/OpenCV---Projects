## 🧠 What is OpenCV?

**OpenCV** (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a real-time optimized toolkit for processing images and videos, enabling the development of applications in areas such as:

- Object detection
- Facial recognition
- Motion tracking
- Image segmentation
- Augmented reality

It supports multiple programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, and supports platforms like Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS.

## ✨ Key Features of OpenCV

- 📸 **Image Processing** – Read, edit, and save images in various formats  
- 🎥 **Video Analysis** – Capture, analyze, and modify real-time video streams  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** – Built-in support for object detection and classification  
- 🔍 **Computer Vision Algorithms** – Face recognition, edge detection, feature matching, and more  
- 🧰 **Cross-platform and GPU Support** – Write once, run anywhere with CUDA support for high performance
